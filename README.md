# 🚀 Swift Concurrency Practice  

This repository is a comprehensive resource for practicing modern Swift concurrency concepts and techniques. The goal is to master Swift's concurrency model and effectively apply it in real-world projects.  

---

## 📚 Contents  

This repository covers the following key concepts and implementations:  

1. **🔄 Async-Await**  
   - Basics of `async` and `await` for handling asynchronous tasks.  
   - Performance evaluation with `Task.task` and `async let`.  

2. **🎭 Actors**  
   - Introduction to `Actor` for managing state in a concurrent-safe manner.  
   - Exploring `non-isolated` state and dedicated code for actors.  
   - Use of global actors for shared resources.  

3. **⚠️ Error Handling**  
   - Leveraging `do`, `try`, `catch`, `throws`, and `throw` for error handling in async contexts.  

4. **🔒 Escaping Closures & Result Enum**  
   - Working with escaping closures and `Result` enum for robust async patterns.  

5. **👥 Task Groups**  
   - Using task groups to manage concurrent tasks effectively.  

6. **🌀 Continuations**  
   - Bridging synchronous and asynchronous code with continuations.  

7. **✅ Sendable Protocols**  
   - Implementing `Sendable` protocols for thread-safe communication.  

8. **📡 Async Publisher & Published**  
   - Working with `AsyncPublisher` and the `@Published` property wrapper.  

9. **🧠 Memory Management**  
   - Understanding strong and weak references in async contexts.  

10. **🏗️ MVVM Pattern and Clean Architecture**  
    - Applying concurrency in the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern.  
    - Integrating clean architecture principles for scalable projects.  

11. **🔄 Refreshable Modules**  
    - Implementing refreshable views and components.  

12. **🔍 Searchable and Search Suggestions**  
    - Adding searchable functionalities and dynamic search suggestions.  

13. **📷 Photo Pickers**  
    - Integrating SwiftUI's photo picker functionality.  

14. **🌊 Async Stream**  
    - Utilizing `AsyncStream` for handling streams of data.  

15. **👀 Observables**  
    - Building observable objects and leveraging Swift's Combine framework.
