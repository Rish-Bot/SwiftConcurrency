# Swift Concurrency Practice  

This repository is a comprehensive resource for practicing modern Swift concurrency concepts and techniques. 
The goal is to master Swift's concurrency model and effectively apply it in real-world projects.  

## Contents  

This repository covers the following key concepts and implementations:  

1. **Async-Await**  
   - Basics of `async` and `await` for handling asynchronous tasks.  
   - Performance evaluation with `Task.task` and `async let`.  

2. **Actors**  
   - Introduction to `Actor` for managing state in a concurrent-safe manner.  
   - Exploring `non-isolated` state and dedicated code for actors.  
   - Use of global actors for shared resources.  

3. **Error Handling**  
   - Leveraging `do`, `try`, `catch`, `throws`, and `throw` for error handling in async contexts.  

4. **Escaping Closures & Result Enum**  
   - Working with escaping closures and `Result` enum for robust async patterns.  

5. **Task Groups**  
   - Using task groups to manage concurrent tasks effectively.  

6. **Continuations**  
   - Bridging synchronous and asynchronous code with continuations.  

7. **Sendable Protocols**  
   - Implementing `Sendable` protocols for thread-safe communication.  

8. **Async Publisher & Published**  
   - Working with `AsyncPublisher` and the `@Published` property wrapper.  

9. **Memory Management**  
   - Understanding strong and weak references in async contexts.  

10. **MVVM Pattern and Clean Architecture**  
    - Applying concurrency in the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern.  
    - Integrating clean architecture principles for scalable projects.  

11. **Refreshable Modules**  
    - Implementing refreshable views and components.  

12. **Searchable and Search Suggestions**  
    - Adding searchable functionalities and dynamic search suggestions.  

13. **Photo Pickers**  
    - Integrating SwiftUI's photo picker functionality.  

14. **Async Stream**  
    - Utilizing `AsyncStream` for handling streams of data.  

15. **Observables**  
    - Building observable objects and leveraging Swift's Combine framework.  

## Structure  

- **Concepts**: Each concept is explained with dedicated examples and best practices.  
- **Projects**: Mini-projects demonstrating the application of these concepts in real-world scenarios.
